## Lessons Learned

While working on this project, We learned the importance of teamwork in effectively completing a project. By working together with team, We were able to utilize out knowledge of Git and GitHub to collaborate on the code and maintain a seamless workflow.

One of the challenges We faced during the project was toggling the state between light and dark mode. To overcome this challenge, We utilized our knowledge of state management in React and worked with my team to implement a solution that allowed users to easily switch between the two modes. Through this process, we gained a deeper understanding of React and improved our problem-solving skills.


## Features

- Light/dark mode toggle
- Live previews
- Calculate with Keyboard and Mouse both
- Cross platform
